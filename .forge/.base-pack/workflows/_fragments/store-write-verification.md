## Store-Write Verification

Every `forge_store` write MUST succeed before advancing. If `store-cli` exits
non-zero or the `PreToolUse` write-boundary hook blocks the call (exit 2):

1. Parse the structured error (names the offending field + schema file).
2. Correct the JSON to satisfy the schema.
3. Retry. Repeat up to 3 times.
4. After 3 failures, halt and escalate with original payload, corrected payload, and all error messages.

Never set `FORGE_SKIP_WRITE_VALIDATION=1` — operator-only emergency switch.
